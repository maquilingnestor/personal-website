                        My name is Nestor Maquiling jr, I live in Purok 5
                        I'm 23 years old and I'm currently a 1st year college student in Blancia College Foundation Inc. (BCFI)
                        I took the course in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)

                    <b>Family</b><br>
                    <p>
                       My family is a diverse and tightly-knit group, spanning multiple generations and cultural
                       backgrounds. From our ancestors who emigrated to seek a better life, to the love that has
                       always been the bedrock of our unity, our shared traditions and values have held us together.
                       Despite facing numerous challenges, we have overcome them with unwavering resilience
                       and celebrated our triumphs together. As we look ahead, our family is evolving and growing,
                       and we are dedicated to preserving our legacy of love, unity, and cherished traditions for
                       generations to come.

                    <b>Friends</b><br>
                    <p>
                        Friendship is a precious gem that adorns the mosaic of my life, each friend a unique facet.
                        Childhood friends are the bedrock, understanding me in a way no one else can; college
                        buddies, a kaleidoscope of shared adventures, laughter, and dreams; work pals, reliable
                        companions through the daily grind, offering camaraderie and support; and new friends,
                        exciting additions with whom I'm building fresh connections. These friendships, old and new,
                        are like a constellation in the night sky, each star representing a different but equally
                        cherished friend, collectively illuminating the path of my life with joy, love, and countless
                        unforgettable moments.
